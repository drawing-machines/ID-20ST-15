###Course Repository, ID-20ST-15


Welcome to Drawing Machines! This repository contains all software and firmware examples used throughout the 2015 RISD ID Drawing Machines Course (ID-20ST-15).

Thise repository will primarily make use of two branches: `master` and `dev`. The `master` branch will be the most stable and tested code, while the development (or dev) branch will less stable and tested code, used for development. At times you may see feature branches (i.e. `some-new-feature`). These are used to develop (big surprise) new features (or separate streams of work) that will eventually get pulled back into the `dev` branch, and later into the stable (and tested) `master` branch. You shouldn't need to use code in any of the feature or development branches unless you are contributing to the code examples in some way. If you would like to contribute code please contact `mmansion@risd.edu` or `kuanju@tellart.com`. Note that you are free to fork any of the branches and develop separate streams of work at any time.
